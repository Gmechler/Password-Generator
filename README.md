# Password-Generator

This project was filled with ups and downs. 
This assignment was to build a password generator that would take in user specified parameters to produce a custom password. I first completed the Html and CSS using bootstrap. I really struggled with the grid system last week so I was very proud of myself that I was able to successfully and fairly confidently lay out the Html that I wanted and style it using bootstrap classes. In my original design I believe I may have been a bit ambitious. I build the html with forms so that the user would type in the answers. The intention was to allow for more than just true false. I wanted the user to be able to answer yes to numbers and have 1-9 be included or they could also enter 1-5 and only 1-5 would be included. I would have also needed to add messaging to address when a number was not used. Ultimately, this is where I messed up I planned to much and couldn’t wrap my head around the complexity. After I realized that I was stuck I decided to go with a simpler design as I knew I was not going to be able to do all the input validations correctly.
I have left several of my dead ends commented out in the code because I would like to come back to this project and complete it the way I planned.

> > > > > What I was able to accomplish<<<<<

I was able to complete the HTML and bootstrap CSS confidently. I also included on element of ccs code.
I was able to use querySelector and getElementById successfully and confidently.
I was able to create buttons and addEventListener to them.
I was able to produce a for loop that uses the user desired password length to generate a password of that length.
I was able to get the copy button working although this was mostly just understanding how to connect copied code into mine.

I will be submitting the working version that can complete these things.

I struggled with debugging and returning correct console.log()
I would have liked to utilized the user input in my orginal concept
